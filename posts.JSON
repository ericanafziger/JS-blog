We did a little exploring of downtown PDX and Waterfront Park before heading across the Morrison Bridge to catch the last rays of the sun on the water. These two did an awesome job of pretending they weren't cold, despite the fact that this had to have been one of the coldest days of the year. At least it wasn't raining! This shoot was a great reminder of how many awesome spots there are to photograph in central Portland.",

    "text": "Senior portraits are always such a blast. An hour or two of striking a pose (insert girl raising hand emoji here)! To top it off, I got to do these portraits with my favorite/only sister. We started out on the football field of her school before heading to a nearby park for some nature shots. She also brought along glitter, meaning we were both covered in it by the end of the night. I love the different feels of the two locations and try as I might I can't pick a favorite set.",
